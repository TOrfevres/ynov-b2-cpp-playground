# YNOV INGESUP B2 CPP Playground 

Please, download "boost_1_66_0.zip" at `http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_66_0.html`.\
Unzip the archive in a folder named `lib/` at project root (should create a "boost_1_66_0" folder).\
Then, build and run !

This file `"/cmake-build-debug/Initiation.exe"` is supposed to be already build and operational.
